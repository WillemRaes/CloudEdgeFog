Cloud Edge and Fog Computing
===================================


Cloud Computing
-----------------------------------
Cloud computing is the well established computing paradigm where the main goal is to enable ubiquitus and on-demand network access
to a shared pool of computing resources which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. [NIST and sensors advances]
An essential characteristic of cloud computing is that it eliminates the need of on-premise computing infrastructure and its maintenance and management.
Cloud computing offers solutions according to the following service models:

- Software as a service (SaaS) 

- Platform as a service (PaaS)

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
